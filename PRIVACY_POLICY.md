# Privacy Policy for BlurChat - Privacy for WhatsApp Web

**Last Updated:** December 25, 2024

## Overview

BlurChat is a browser extension that adds visual privacy protection to WhatsApp Web by applying CSS blur effects to chat content. This extension is developed independently and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to WhatsApp Inc. or Meta Platforms, Inc.**

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

### What We DON'T Collect:
- ❌ Message content or text
- ❌ Contact information or names
- ❌ Phone numbers
- ❌ Media files (photos, videos)
- ❌ Usage analytics or statistics
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Any identifiable information

### What We Store Locally:
The following data is stored **only on your device** using Chrome's local storage API:
- ✅ Your blur preference settings (on/off toggles)
- ✅ Pro license key (if activated)
- ✅ Extension enabled state

This data **never leaves your browser** and is not accessible to us or any third party.

## How the Extension Works

BlurChat works entirely through CSS style injection:
1. When you visit WhatsApp Web, the extension injects CSS rules
2. These CSS rules apply visual blur filters to selected elements
3. Hovering reveals content temporarily via CSS `:hover` states
4. No JavaScript reads, processes, or transmits your message content

## Network Requests

**This extension makes ZERO network requests.**

All functionality is performed locally within your browser. We have no servers, no analytics, and no external dependencies.

## Third-Party Services

BlurChat does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or analytics platforms.

## Permissions

The extension requests minimal permissions:
- **storage**: To save your preference settings locally
- **host_permissions (web.whatsapp.com)**: To apply blur styles on WhatsApp Web

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect any data from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date.
